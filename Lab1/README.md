# Classes in Java
For this lab activity, we were tasked to create a class Triangle. The class has attributes height and base, each of which defaults to 1. 
It has member functions that calculate the area of the triangle. It has set and get functions for both height and base. The set functions should
verify that base and height are each floating point numbers larger than 0.0 and less than 20.
