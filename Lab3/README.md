# Lab3 - Inheritance Activity
Given a tree, the task is to construct the class structure of each of the classes. And determine what member and data functions are unique to a class. 
For a base class, think of what member data and functions are common to all of its derived classes. 
We need to write a driver program that tests that the classes are working properly.
