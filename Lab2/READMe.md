# Write a Max function in Java 
The function should compare integers, real numbers, or strings, and returns the largest one.

The functions can have two or three parameters of the same type.

Given the Test program written in C++, we were tasked to translate the program in Java and do the given specification for the program.

## Test program written in C++
main()

 {
 
   cout << Max(2, 4);
   
   cout << Max(5.5, 5.3, 5.0);
   
   cout << Max(“Baguio”, “Diliman”, “Manila”);
   
   cout << Max(5,5,5);
   
}

 ## The output:
 4
 
 5.5
 
 Diliman
 
 5
